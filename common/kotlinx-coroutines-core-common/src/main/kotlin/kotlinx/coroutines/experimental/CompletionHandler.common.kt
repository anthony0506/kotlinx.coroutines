/**
 * Handler for [Job.invokeOnCompletion].
 *
 * Installed handler should not throw any exceptions. If it does, they will get caught,
 * wrapped into [CompletionHandlerException], and rethrown, potentially causing crash of unrelated code.
 *
 * **Note**: This type is a part of internal machinery that supports parent-child hierarchies
 * and allows for implementation of suspending functions that wait on the Job's state.
 * This type should not be used in general application code.
 * Implementations of `CompletionHandler` must be fast and _lock-free_.
