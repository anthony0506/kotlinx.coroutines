# Change log for kotlinx.coroutines 


## Version 0.6-rc

* Switched to Kotlin version 1.1.0-rc.

## Version 0.5-beta

* Switched to Kotlin version 1.1.0-beta-22 (republished version).
* Removed `currentCoroutineContext` and related thread-locals without replacement.
  Explicitly pass coroutine context around if needed.
* `lazyDefer(context) {...}` coroutine builder and `LazyDeferred` interface are introduced.
* The default behaviour of all coroutine dispatchers is changed to always schedule execution of new coroutine 
  for later in this thread or thread pool. Correspondingly, `CoroutineDispatcher.isDispatchNeeded` function
  has a default implementation that returns `true`.
* `NonCancellable` context is introduced.  
* Performance optimizations for cancellable continuations (fewer objects created).
* A [guide on coroutines](coroutines-guide.md) is added.  

## Version 0.4-beta

* Switched to Kotlin version 1.1.0-beta-18 (republished version).
* `CoroutineDispatcher` methods now have `context` parameter.
* Introduced `CancellableContinuation.isCancelled`
* Introduced `EventLoop` dispatcher and made it a default for `runBlocking { ... }`
* Introduced `CoroutineScope` interface with `isActive` and `context` properties; 
  standard coroutine builders include it as receiver for convenience.
* Introduced `Executor.toCoroutineDispatcher()` extension.  
* Delay scheduler thread is not daemon anymore, but times out automatically.
* Debugging facilities in `newCoroutineContext` can be explicitly disabled with `-Dkotlinx.coroutines.debug=off`.
* xxx-test files are renamed to xxx-example for clarity.
* Fixed NPE in Job implementation when starting coroutine with already cancelled parent job.
* Support cancellation in `kotlinx-coroutines-nio` module
