/**
 * Debug probes support.
 *
 * Debug probes is a dynamic attach mechanism, which installs multiple hooks into [Continuation] machinery.
 * It slows down all coroutine-related code, but in return provides a lot of debug information, including
 * asynchronous stack-traces and coroutine dumps (similar to [ThreadMXBean.dumpAllThreads] and `jstack` via [DebugProbes.dumpCoroutines].
 *
 * Installed hooks:
 *
 * * `probeCoroutineResumed` is invoked on every [Continuation.resume].
 * * `probeCoroutineSuspended` is invoked on every continuation suspension.
 * * `probeCoroutineCreated` is invoked on every coroutine creation using stdlib intrinsics.
 *
 * Overhead:
 *  * Every created continuation is stored in a weak hash map, thus adding additional GC pressure.
 *  * On every created continuation, stacktrace of the current thread is dumped.
 *  * On every `resume` and `suspend`, [WeakHashMap] is updated under a global lock.
 *
 * **WARNING: DO NOT USE DEBUG PROBES IN PRODUCTION ENVIRONMENT.**
