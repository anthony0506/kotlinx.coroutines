/**
 * Deferred value is a non-blocking cancellable future.
 * It is created with [async] coroutine builder.
 * It is in [active][isActive] state while the value is being computed.
 *
 * Deferred value has four or five possible states.
 *
 * | **State**                        | [isActive] | [isCompleted] | [isCompletedExceptionally] | [isCancelled] |
 * | -------------------------------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------------------------- | ------------- |
 * | _New_ (optional initial state)   | `false`    | `false`       | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Active_ (default initial state) | `true`     | `false`       | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Resolved_  (final state)        | `false`    | `true`        | `false`                    | `false`       |
 * | _Failed_    (final state)        | `false`    | `true`        | `true`                     | `false`       |
 * | _Cancelled_ (final state)        | `false`    | `true`        | `true`                     | `true`        |
 *
 * Usually, a deferred value is created in _active_ state (it is created and started), so its only visible
 * states are _active_ and _completed_ (_resolved_, _failed_, or _cancelled_) state.
 * However, [async] coroutine builder has an optional `start` parameter that creates a deferred value in _new_ state
 * when this parameter is set to `false`.
 * Such a deferred can be be made _active_ by invoking [start], [join], or [await].
