// --------------- core job interfaces ---------------

/**
 * A background job. It is created with [launch] coroutine builder or with a
 * [`Job()`][Job.Key.invoke] factory function.
 * A job can be _cancelled_ at any time with [cancel] function that forces it to become _completed_ immediately.
 *
 * A job has two or three states:
 *
 * | **State**                        | [isActive] | [isCompleted] |
 * | _New_ (optional initial state)   | `false`    | `false`       |
 * | _Active_ (default initial state) | `true`     | `false`       |
 * | _Completed_ (final state)        | `false`    | `true`        |
 *
 * Usually, a job is created in _active_ state (it is created and started), so its only visible
 * states are _active_ and _completed_. However, coroutine builders that provide an optional `start` parameter
 * create a coroutine in _new_ state when this parameter is set to `false`. Such a job can
 * be made _active_ by invoking [start] or [join].
 *
 * A job in the coroutine [context][CoroutineScope.context] represents the coroutine itself.
 * A job is active while the coroutine is working and job's cancellation aborts the coroutine when
 * the coroutine is suspended on a _cancellable_ suspension point by throwing [CancellationException]
 * or the cancellation cause inside the coroutine.
 *
 * A job can have a _parent_. A job with a parent is cancelled when its parent completes.
 *
 * All functions on this interface and on all interfaces derived from it are **thread-safe** and can
 * be safely invoked from concurrent coroutines without external synchronization.
